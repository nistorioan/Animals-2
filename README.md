# WhackATerror
Game on Java Programming Language
This game is created for my collage project.
“Whack-a-Terror” is a arcade game, this game is very similar to the Whack-a-mole game.
It has numbers of holes in its top and each hole contains a single terrorist.
The terrorist will pop up from their holes at random and the player should kill the terrorist with his virtual gun at a given time period.
You can edit or modify these code according to your needs.
